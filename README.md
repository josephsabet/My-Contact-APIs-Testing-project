## 📏 Guidelines

- Create a **new Postman workspace** and invite all team members.
- Set up a **new Trello board**:
  - Create a card for each API
  - Assign tasks clearly
- Ensure Postman Collection:
  - Is well-structured and organized
  - Includes requests for all relevant API endpoints
  - Contains **tests in the "Tests" tab** (JavaScript assertions)
  - Use **environment variables** (base URLs, tokens)
- Push all work to GitHub.

## 💡 Tips

- **Positive Test Case Example:**  
  `POST` request with all required fields → verify success response.

- **Negative Test Case Example:**  
  `POST` request with missing required fields → verify proper error response.

- Explore the app UI to identify and cover more relevant test scenarios.  
  *(Verify mapping between GUI and API)*
